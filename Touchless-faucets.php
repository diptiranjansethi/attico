                        When washing hands using a conventional tap, you must touch it with your dirty hands to turn it on—leaving behind germs, bacteria, and viruses. Automatic taps controlled by a sensor are therefore a good alternative
                        for making hand washing more hygienic, especially in households where multiple people live. Since the tap is controlled via an infrared sensor, you don't have to touch it at all and germs and bacteria have less
                        chance of spreading.

            <h1>HYGIENIC HAND WASHING WITH INFRARED TAPS</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="sdt">
            <p>
                GROHE’s infrared sensor taps, allow for a completely new way of washing your hands. The sensor registers when your hands are approaching and automatically activates the flow of water. If the tap's sensor no longer detects
                movement, the water jet will automatically turn off.
            </p>
            <p>
                Not only does this make GROHE's automatic taps easy to operate, it also makes them <strong>extremely hygienic</strong>. Operating a tap with dirty hands leaves behind germs, which can then be transferred to the another
                person. Touch-free operation prevents this from happening.

                        <p>
                            During the design process, the GROHE team contemplated how to achieve the best possible hygiene. The touch-free tap’s water supply was optimised so that cold and hot water are perfectly mixed. At the same time,
                            dead spaces in the tap were <strong>kept to a minimum</strong> to reduce the risk of bacteria such as legionella from multiplying.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            These sensor taps are equipped with additional functions that ensure even greater hygiene which include regular <strong>automatic rinsing</strong> to prevent stagnant water. Additionally, both thermal
                            disinfection and a cleaning mode can be used to temporarily deactivate the sensor for cleaning. Furthermore, as the tap is rarely touched, cleaning can be carried out less frequently than when using aconventional
                            tap.

            <p>
                GROHE’s automatic taps are not only hygienic, but also extremely convenient. You can easily preselect the temperature of the water jet and as the tap is activated via the sensor, the water comes out at the desired
                temperature.
            </p>
            <p>Using highly precise sensors, hand movements are reliably detected and activate the water flow. The infrared sensor also detects when you move your hands away from the tap and automatically stops the water flow.</p>

                        <p>
                            GROHE sensor taps can be installed <strong>without any prior plumbing knowledge</strong> using the optional remote control or a smartphone/tablet app on select models. You can also change the pre-set sensitivity
                            of the sensor and how long the water should continue to flow after no more movement is detected. The water temperature can also be adjusted manually using a small lever on the side of the tap.
                        </p>
                        <p>Battery operated models require little maintenance. The extremely durable batteries last about seven years when the tap is used an average of 150 times per day.</p>
